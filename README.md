# Webpack installation

During this short tutorial, we will be installing webpack from scratch.

## What do you need?
You will need a computer with Node and NPM installed.

1. Check your version of NPM:

```sh
$ npm -v
```

Note: You need at least the 3.5 version of NPM to avoid any performance issues.


**Nota: si la version de npm es >= 6 asegurate de usar una versiÃ³n de node >=10**

2. Create a new npm package

```sh
$ npm init -y
```

3. Install webpack

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev webpack
```

4. We want to be able to bunble CSS file into our JS bundles, for that we need both the Style and CSS loaders.

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
```

5. We also want to use SCSS (Sass) syntaxt.

```sh
$ npm install sass-loader node-sass webpack --save-dev
```
